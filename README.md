## Available Information
- **Penetration Capability**
  - Penetration capability against the armor belt (the impact angle and normalization are taken into account!)
- **Falling Angle**
  - Can be visible when the Alt-key is pressed, or in the tooltip
  - It is also possible to keep it always visible in another row (Change the option via TTaro Mod Config)
- **Ricochet Angles**
  - Some visualizations will help you to understand it as well.
 
## Customizations
With [TTaro Mod Config](../../../TTaroModConfig)  (which is automatically downloaded with this mod if you install the mod from Aslain), players can customize some elements.

Resetting to default is easy - Just click the gear icon next to each option.
So don't hesitate and try various settings!

- **Theme**
  - hange the color of the font to your preference.
- **Always Show Impact Angle**
  - By enabling this option, the impact angle will always be displayed in another row, instead of toggling with the Alt key.
- **Height Offset**
  - You can apply a custom offset so my mod doesn't overwrap with other mods. 

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!
